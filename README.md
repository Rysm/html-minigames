# A Small Collection of HTML Canvas/Javascript Based Games

These games were made during my undergraduate game design program, and are only a small sample of the work I have done. Best played in Chrome. (I am pretty sure these won't work on Safari. I tried!)

The type of games found in this collection are : 

1. An endless runner game with its premise based off the story of the Little Match Girl. Collect flames to keep yourself alive for a little bit longer in the harsh cold.

2. A simple Pokemon training/evolving using simple Alchemy inspired mechanics of drag/drop/clicking.

3. A snake game, but the food can decay and disappear. The timer is currently set to a very lenient value, so its effect is not immediately obvious. (500 seconds).

4. A simple twine text horror story game. Made to incorporate a killer character who will also change his position everytime the player decides to take a link.
