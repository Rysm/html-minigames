Instructions:

    - DragEmAll is a drag-n-drop game where you have four Pokemon. (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Pikachu.)
    
    - There are two screens. The upper is a safe area. The lower is the battle screen. When a Pokemon is in the battle area,
    then pressing shift will earn it exp. Enemy types may change as you level up your Pokemon.
    
    - Each Pokemon has its own level and experience points.

    - Once each Pokemon has reached a certain level, you can evolve them by dragging an evolution stone to them.
